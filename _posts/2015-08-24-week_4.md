This week was mostly an Eigen week. Alloy got our app compliling and running on iOS 9. I worked moved our networking stack to using modern APIs, this means we will get all of the security features in iOS9 "for free". Jory has been consolidating some of our testing APIs, and added warning on the sign up pages when you have invalid data.

We ran our first Learn Swift at Artsy classes, where we taught beginners and informed programmers the Swift language. We've been opening up all of the materials and made them available for people outside of the Artsy office.
