OSS Energy and Moya / Forgeries

<!-- more -->

A large amount of time from Sarah and I went to finishing up the 2.4.0 release of Folio. With towards the end of the week we then [Open Source'd Folio](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/06/open-sourcing-energy/).

Alloy's been on holiday, Jory too. So not much on the eigen front.

Ash devoted some time to making a pod that collected the testing fakes we have in different projects under the awesome name of [Forgeries](https://github.com/ashfurrow/Forgeries). He also got our network API pod [Moya](https://github.com/moya) converted into a GitHub organization allowing for the project to get more use than just the Artsy use-cases.

We also held the [Swift Soire√©e](http://www.meetup.com/CocoaPods-NYC/events/223977596/) Wednesday evening. It went well, and got valuable feedback we can use for any future meetups.
