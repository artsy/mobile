## 2015-07-31

We did the Artsy Offsite, wrote about debugging, and have had a quiet week.

<!-- more -->

The majority of our week was taken up by the Artsy Annual offsite that brought everyone to the outskirts of NYC. I [took selfies](https://orta.exposure.co/artsy-offsite-2015).

This week wrapped was the last with 1aura Brown on the team, and the first with Jory Steifel. A swap between the web team inside artsy. Since I announced our [interest in hiring two more people](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/commit/7c7344bfc606512a6d3b779d1552261f358b7a52), I've been dealing with an influx of job applications, lots of emails and lots of time.

Alloy wrote a great blog post on some of the more advanced techniques he uses for debugging hard crashes within the eigen codebase.

Eidolon started to get some momentum at the start of the week:

* [Lets users dismiss bid confirmation view by tapping checkmark](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/pull/489)
* [Displays thumbnail on detail view while fullsize image is being downloaded](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/pull/488)
* [Tapping anywhere in the list cell pushes the detail VC](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/pull/487)
* [Fixes crash on grid view ](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/pull/486)
* [Adds new backend estimateCents field to SaleArtwork model](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/pull/485)

Energy has some WIP Pull Requests around ensuring we always set up Partners correctly. We're aiming for a release next week.

I've also wrapped up some work on connecting to the [Echo](https://github.com/artsy/echo) admin tool as a Pod, [Aerodramus](https://github.com/artsy/Aerodramus).
