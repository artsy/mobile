# 2015-08-15
This week, the mobile team interviewed 4 people, this took up a very large amount of the start/middle of the week. I devoted some weekend time, and Monday to programmatically creating an [xcodeproject from a Podspec](https://github.com/orta/cocoapods_generate_unit_tests). Perhaps when we start making smaller libraries this will come in handy. I also gave a talk at Princeton on being an iOS dev at Artsy.

Artsy had a hackathon on Wed/Thurs, where I hacked up a Artsy/Instagram mashup, Ash worked on a team navigator and I have no idea what Sarah got up to. She left for berlin on vacation on thursday. Just as she left, Jory arrived back and he got his first PR on [Eigen in](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/pull/730). Alloy is still out of office.

We recieved 2 open source pull requests on eigen this week, way more then usual. I feel guilty about my three PRs over there.

Energy was accepted in to the App Store, but we found a blocking bug, so will probably push a new build with a fix on monday.

Ash wrote an aspirational piece to encourage more companies to make things like the [CocoaPods Peer Labs](http://www.meetup.com/CocoaPods-NYC/), it [was cool](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab/).
